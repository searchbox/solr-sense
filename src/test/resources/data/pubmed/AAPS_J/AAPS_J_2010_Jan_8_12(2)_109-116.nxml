Annual vaccinations are the most effective strategy to prevent and control influenza infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>). Most of the available influenza vaccines are administered via the intramuscular (i.m.) or subcutaneous route. These parenteral vaccines induce good systemic immune response but no mucosal immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>), which limits their protective efficacy. In contrast, intranasal (i.n.) vaccines may induce both systemic and mucosal immune responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>). In addition, i.n. delivery of the vaccine does not require trained health care personnel for the administration of vaccine, is suitable for people with needle phobia, and circumvents the problem of needlestick injuries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>).</p><p>A mucosal immune response is necessary for the protection of the upper respiratory tract, i.e., the port of entry for influenza virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>). The protection of the upper respiratory tract is mainly provided by sIgA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>). Moreover, sIgA is known to induce cross-protection against variant viruses within the same subtype and also increase the protection during epidemics of heterologous viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>). Furthermore, it is reported that the mucosal immune system develops early in life and is not affected by aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>). Therefore, a concomitant advantage of i.n. influenza immunization is that it can potentially provide effective immunity in all age groups and can be used for mass vaccination.</p><p>Currently, live attenuated influenza virus vaccines (LAIV) are marketed for i.n. administration. LAIV vaccines have shown to induce both systemic and mucosal immune responses. However, LAIV vaccine is licensed by the Food and Drug Administration only for persons aged 2&#x02013;49&#x000a0;years but not for use in high-risk populations (elderly, children, and chronically ill patients) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>). However, most of the marketed influenza vaccines are inactivated vaccines which can be administered safely via i.n. route to the whole population. A disadvantage of these vaccines is that they have shown to be poorly immunogenic when administered via this route (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>).</p><p>To increase the immunogenicity, inactivated influenza vaccines require adjuvants to potentiate the immune response when administered via the i.n. route. Several adjuvants are currently under development for i.n. immunizations like virus-like particles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>), immunostimulating complexes (ISCOMS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>), lipids, nucleic acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>), and bacterial components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>). However, the development of many of these adjuvants systems is hampered by safety and regulatory concerns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>). For example, potent bacterial adjuvants like heat liable toxin of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (LT) have shown severe side effects in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>). Therefore, an adjuvant for i.n. inactivated influenza vaccine that is potent and safe for human use is still lacking.</p><p>The novel adjuvant Gram-positive enhancer matrix (GEM) particles are produced from the food-grade bacterium <italic>Lactococcus lactis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>). <italic>L. lactis</italic> is a nonpathogenic, noncolonizing Gram-positive bacterium. Moreover, <italic>L. lactis</italic> is approved for human use by regulatory agencies and considered as a generally recognized as safe (GRAS) organism. The GEM particles are produced by heating the <italic>L. lactis</italic> in acid, followed by washing with phosphate buffer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>). The resulting particles are nonliving, deprived of intact surface proteins and intracellular content. The thick peptidoglycan cell wall, however, remains intact and provides the structural rigidity to constitute the bacterial-shaped peptidoglycan spheres of about 1&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m in size, referred to as GEM particles. The GEM particles have been studied for mucosal vaccination of malarial parasite antigen and pneumococcal antigens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>). These studies demonstrated that antigens displayed on GEM particles induced higher immune response than antigen alone. Since GEM particles are a promising adjuvant for i.n. immunization, the aim of this study was to investigate the use of GEM particles as adjuvant for i.n. influenza vaccination.</p><p>In this study, we examined the immunogenicity in Balb/c mice of i.n. administered influenza subunit vaccine mixed with GEM particles as adjuvant. In earlier studies, the antigens (pneumococcal and malarial) were covalently bound to the GEM particles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>). In contrast, in the present study, the particles were simply mixed with the antigens. The immune response was compared to i.m. and i.n. administered subunit influenza vaccine without the adjuvant.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>Influenza monovalent subunit vaccine of strain A/Wisconsin (H3N2) was kindly provided by Solvay Pharmaceuticals (Weesp, The Netherlands).

The cells were resuspended in 10% trichloroacetic acid and placed in a hot water bath of 99&#x000b0;C for 30&#x000a0;min. The acid and heat treatment kills the bacteria and generates the so-called GEM particles. After acid and heat treatment, the GEM particles were pelleted and washed three times in phosphate buffered saline (PBS; Dulbecco&#x02019;s phosphate buffered saline without CaCl<sub>2</sub> and MgCl<sub>2</sub>) and finally resuspended in PBS and stored at &#x02212;20&#x000b0;C.

IgG subtype profiling (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>) showed that i.n. immunization with subunit vaccine alone induced low IgG1, IgG2a, and IgG2b responses. As previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>), i.m. immunization with subunit vaccine induced high IgG1 responses but little IgG2a and IgG2b, indicating an immune response biased toward a Th2-type response. In comparison to i.m. immunization, i.n. immunization with HA + GEM induced significant higher IgG2a (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.042) and IgG2b (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.030) and lower IgG1 (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.0135) responses. These results indicate that the antibody responses generated by i.n. HA + GEM vaccine is significantly more skewed toward a Th1 phenotype than the conventional i.m. vaccine.

I.m. immunization with subunit vaccine resulted in a higher number of IL-4-producing cells than IFN-&#x003b3;-producing cells, indicating again a predominated Th2-type response.

Our results show that intranasally administered subunit vaccine adjuvanted with GEM particles (which are simply mixed with vaccine) can be used in a prime-boost vaccination strategy to induce protective levels of HI titers (&#x0003e;<sup>2</sup>log5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>)), which is considered to be an important correlate of protection. In addition, the serum IgG results clearly highlight that GEM particles enhance the immunogenicity of the i.n. administered influenza subunit vaccine.</p><p>In addition to substantial serum responses, the GEM adjuvanted i.n. vaccine elicited a strong mucosal immune response, i.e., secretion of the sIgA in the respiratory mucosa. These results are consistent with earlier studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>) in which GEM bound pneumococcal i.n. vaccine induced strong mucosal responses. Induction of significant levels of sIgA in nasal mucosa shows that GEM particles act as immunopotentiators in the nasal mucosa. The immune system of the nasal mucosa consists of the nasal-associated lymphoid tissue (NALT). In the NALT, the antigens are taken up by the M-cells and then presented to antigen-presenting cells, which in turn present antigen fragments to the underlying B and T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>). This cascade of events is required for the initial innate and adaptive immune response against the influenza virus. The induction of sIgA antibodies in the NALT might be the result of an interaction with Toll-like receptor (TLR)-2 of the peptidoglycan present in GEM particles, as it is known that GEM particles act as a TLR-2 agonist in <italic>in vitro</italic> studies (Pasetti <italic>et al.</italic>, manuscript in communication). Furthermore, it is known that GEM particles can activate the maturation of the dendritic cells and macrophages <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>). Thus, both the activation of TLR-2 and maturation of the dendritic cells might have contributed to the stronger mucosal immune response.</p><p>Recently, much emphasis is put on the phenotype of the immune response, i.e., Th1, Th2, or balanced response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>). A Th1 response is considered to be superior to Th2 or a mixed response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>) because it (1) results in better protection from infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>) and (2) helps in virus neutralization by secretion of INF-&#x003b3; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>). Moreover, the natural infection also induces a Th1 type of response. However, subunit vaccine administered via the i.n. route and many of the nasal adjuvants like chitosan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>), ISCOMS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>), lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>), and LT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>) induce a mixed Th1/Th2-type response. In contrast, the i.n. GEM influenza vaccine induced a response skewed toward Th1 type. Thus, GEM particles modulate the response from a balanced to a Th1-skewed response.</p><p>Furthermore, the vaccine formulation presented in this paper is much more convenient to produce compared to most of the other adjuvant systems which have to be preformulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>). The formulation used in these experiments was prepared by ad-mixing the GEM particles with conventional subunit vaccine. GEM particles can be produced in large quantities under sterile conditions and can be stored at ambient temperature for long time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>). The ease of formulation and administration makes i.n. GEM influenza subunit vaccine a promising candidate for vaccination in a pandemic as well as in an epidemic situation.</p><p>A major hurdle in the development of mucosal adjuvants is to proof their safety in order to obtain approval by regulatory agencies. The GEM particles used in this study are safe to use in comparison to other adjuvants and other lactic acid bacteria systems evaluated for vaccination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>). During the production of GEM particles, <italic>L. lactis</italic> bacteria are treated with acid, which results in loss of genetic material. The loss of the genetic material is beneficial as the problem of DNA shedding and infection in the mucosal layer by the bacteria is avoided (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>). Moreover, the GEM particles are produced from a bacterium which is used in the production of dairy products and is considered a GRAS organism. Audouy <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>) reported that GEMs did not induce detectable antibody levels to particles themselves after repeated intranasal administrations in mice. In addition, GEM particles have already been tested intranasally in rabbits in a preclinical GLP toxicity study, and no adverse events were reported (Leenhouts <italic>et al.</italic>, unpublished results). Therefore, GEM particles can be considered as a safe candidate adjuvant for mucosal use in humans.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Our data show that i.n. influenza vaccine adjuvanted with GEM particles induced a comparable systemic immunity and superior mucosal and cell-mediated immunity compared to i.m. immunization with subunit influenza vaccine alone. Importantly, it induced higher sIgA levels which are a first line of defense during influenza infection in the upper respiratory tract. Moreover, it elicited a skewed Th1-type immune response which is considered to provide superior protection. Overall, GEM particles can be regarded as a safe and potent adjuvants for i.n. delivered influenza subunit vaccine.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Solvay Pharmaceuticals for providing the subunit influenza vaccine.</p><p><bold>Open Access</bold> This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Noncommercial License which permits any noncommercial use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author(s) and source are credited.</p></ack><ref-list id="Bib1"><title>References</title><ref id="CR1"><label>1.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other">WHO, influenza, fact sheet 211, revised 2003.</mixed-citation></ref><ref id="CR2"><label>2.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Couch</surname><given-names>RB</given-names></name><name><surname>Kasel</surname><given-names>JA</given-names></name><name><surname>Glezen</surname><given-names>WP</given-names></name><name><surname>Cate</surname><given-names>TR</given-names></name><name><surname>Six</surname><given-names>HR</given-names></name><name><surname>Taber</surname><given-names>LH</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Influenza: its control in persons and populations</article-title><source>J Infect Dis</source><year>1986</year><volume>153</volume><issue>3</issue><fpage>431</fpage><lpage>40</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">3950437</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="CR3"><label>3.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Cox</surname><given-names>RJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Brokstad</surname><given-names>KA</given-names></name><name><surname>Ogra</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Influenza virus: immunity and vaccination strategies.
