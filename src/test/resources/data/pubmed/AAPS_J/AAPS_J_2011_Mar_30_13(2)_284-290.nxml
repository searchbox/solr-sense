Both monovalent metal ions (Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup>) and divalent metal ions (Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Mg<sup>2+</sup>, and Zn<sup>2+</sup>) were tested all as chloride salts. The effect of combinations of buffers and metal ions on the stability of aqueous oxytocin solutions was determined by RP-HPLC and HP-SEC after 4&#x000a0;weeks of storage at either 4&#x000b0;C or 55&#x000b0;C. Addition of sodium or potassium ions to acetate- or citrate-buffered solutions did not increase stability, nor did the addition of divalent metal ions to acetate buffer. However, the stability of aqueous oxytocin in aqueous formulations was improved in the presence of 5 and 10&#x000a0;mM citrate buffer in combination with at least 2&#x000a0;mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, MgCl<sub>2</sub>, or ZnCl<sub>2</sub> and depended on the divalent metal ion concentration. Isothermal titration calorimetric measurements were predictive for the stabilization effects observed during the stability study. Formulations in citrate buffer that had an improved stability displayed a strong interaction between oxytocin and Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Mg<sup>2+</sup>, or Zn<sup>2+</sup>, while formulations in acetate buffer did not. In conclusion, our study shows that divalent metal ions in combination with citrate buffer strongly improved the stability of oxytocin in aqueous solutions.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>KEY WORDS</title><kwd>citrate buffer</kwd><kwd>divalent metal ions</kwd><kwd>improved stability</kwd><kwd>oxytocin</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; American Association of Pharmaceutical Scientists 2011</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>According to the World Health Organization, half a million of women in Africa, Asia, and Latin America die each year due to problems during pregnancy and childbirth. At least 25% of those deaths can be attributed to bleeding after child birth (post-partum hemorrhage), mainly caused by failure of the uterus to contract adequately after child birth (atonicity) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>).</p><p>The preferred drug to prevent post-partum hemorrhage is oxytocin. Oxytocin is a cyclic nonapeptide hormone [sequence: cyclo (Cys<sup>1</sup>-Tyr<sup>2</sup>-Ile<sup>3</sup>-Gln<sup>4</sup>-Asn<sup>5</sup>-Cys<sup>6</sup>, -Pro<sup>7</sup>-Leu<sup>8</sup>-Gly<sup>9</sup>-NH2)], which is naturally produced in the hypothalamus. It is involved primarily in uterine contraction and stimulation of milk release from the mammary tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>). Oxytocin, which is currently available in synthetic form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>), has been widely used for indications such as induction of labor, augmentation of labor, post-partum hemorrhage, or uterine atony, and also for other indications such as diabetes insipidus and vasodilatory shock. Reported additional functions for oxytocin include an antiduretic effect and blood vessel contraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>).</p><p>Unfortunately, oxytocin preparations are highly unstable at elevated temperatures, which is an issue particularly in tropical countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>). Stability studies conducted by Groot <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>) have shown that injectable oxytocin formulations are rapidly degraded as the storage temperature rises to 30&#x000b0;C or higher. Oxytocic tablets for oral administration (ergometrine, ethylergometrine, oxytocin, and desamino-oxytocin) are also not stable under simulated tropical conditions. Because of its poor stability at elevated temperatures, the use of oxytocin in many developing countries is limited. Thus, there is a clear need for a heat-stable oxytocin formulation, preferably an aqueous injectable solution, with improved thermal stability.</p><p>One way to effectively improve stability of several peptides in aqueous solution is using metal salts in combination with a suitable buffer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>). To investigate the effect of metal ions in buffered solutions on the stability of oxytocin, we screened various combinations of unbuffered and buffered solutions with monovalent or divalent metal ions. Hawe <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>) observed that the degradation of oxytocin strongly depends on the pH of the formulation, with the highest stability at pH&#x000a0;4.5. Therefore, all formulations will be set to pH&#x000a0;4.5. The purpose of this study is to investigate whether specific combinations of buffer and metal ions can stabilize oxytocin.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHOD</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Materials</title><p>The following materials were used in this study: oxytocin monoacetate powder (Diosynth, Oss, The Netherlands), citric acid, calcium chloride (Riedel-de Haen, Seelze, Germany), acetic acid, magnesium chloride, zinc chloride (Fluka, Steinheim, Germany), sodium hydroxide, sodium chloride, potassium chloride, sodium dihydrogen phosphate dihydrate, acetonitrile, formic acid (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) and Baxter Viavlo Ringer's lactate solution for intravenous infusion (Baxter, Utrecht, The Netherlands).</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Formulation and Stability Study</title><p>Oxytocin was formulated at a concentration of 0.1&#x000a0;mg/ml in citrate (5 or 10&#x000a0;mM) or acetate (10&#x000a0;mM) buffer at pH&#x000a0;4.5 (pH adjusted with sodium hydroxide) with different additions of metal ions. pH samples were controlled and remained within &#x000b1;0.1 pH units during the stability study. The initial concentration of oxytocin was determined using UV spectrophotometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>) at 280&#x000a0;nm with an extinction coefficient of 1.52&#x000a0;ml&#x000a0;mg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>&#x000a0;cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>. All metal ion solutions were prepared using their chloride salts at concentrations of 2, 5, 10, and 50&#x000a0;mM. Control solutions were formulated in water (pH&#x000a0;6.9&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.2) and Ringers's lactate (6.4&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.2). Ringers's lactate solution consists of 131&#x000a0;mM sodium, 5&#x000a0;mM potassium, 2&#x000a0;mM calcium, 111&#x000a0;mM chloride, and 29&#x000a0;mM bicarbonate (as lactate).

Following digit(s) refer to buffer concentration in mM, following character(s) to the type of metal ion, and last digit(s) to metal ion concentration in mM.

Microcalorimetric titrations of divalent metal ions to oxytocin were conducted by using a MicroCal ITC 200 Microcalorimeter (Northampton, MA 01060 USA). A solution of 300&#x000a0;&#x003bc;L of 5&#x000a0;mM oxytocin in 10&#x000a0;mM of either citrate or acetate pH&#x000a0;4.5 was placed in the sample cell, while 30&#x000a0;&#x003bc;L of 125&#x000a0;mM divalent metal chloride either calcium, magnesium, or zinc in 10&#x000a0;mM citrate or acetate buffer pH&#x000a0;4.5 was placed in the syringe. The reference cell contained 300&#x000a0;&#x003bc;L of the corresponding buffer. Experiments were performed at 55&#x000b0;C. Automated titrations were conducted up to a divalent metal ion/oxytocin molar ratio of 5:1. The effective heat of the peptide-metal ion interaction upon each titration step was corrected for dilution and mixing effects, as measured by titrating the divalent metal ion solution into buffer and by titrating buffer into oxytocin solution. To investigate the possibility of oxytocin or metal ion binding to the buffer components, control experiments were performed in water. The heats of bimolecular interactions were obtained by integrating the peak following each injection. All measurements were performed in triplicate.</p><p>ITC data were analyzed by using the ITC non-linear curve fitting functions for one or two binding sites from MicroCal Origin 7.0 software (MicroCal Software, Inc.). The calculated curve was determined by the best-fit parameter, which was used to determine the molar enthalpy change for binding and the corresponding association constant, K<sub>a</sub>. The molar free energy of binding &#x02206;G&#x000b0; and the molar entropy change &#x02206;S&#x000b0; were derived from the fundamental equations of thermodynamics <inline-formula id="IEq1"><alternatives><tex-math id="M1">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

RP-HPLC results (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>) showed that after 4&#x000a0;weeks of storage at 4&#x000b0;C, oxytocin recovery was almost 100% in the presence of 2&#x02013;50&#x000a0;mM zinc or 50&#x000a0;mM calcium ions. No stabilizing effect was observed from the presence of magnesium (2&#x02013;50&#x000a0;mM) and calcium (2&#x02013;10&#x000a0;mM), where the recovery was reduced to about 65%, similar to levels found for oxytocin solutions in water. HP-SEC results (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>) showed a similar trend in the recovery of monomeric oxytocin. However, when the solutions were stored at 55&#x000b0;C, both RP-HPLC and HP-SEC measurements showed substantial degradation of oxytocin after 4&#x000a0;weeks. These results demonstrate that divalent metal ions in non-buffered aqueous oxytocin formulations have only a limited stabilizing effect at elevated temperature.

These combinations exert even a stronger effect on oxytocin stability than combinations of citrate buffer and calcium or magnesium ions. Stability was strongly improved at zinc concentrations as low as 2 or 5&#x000a0;mM.

Even though the oxytocin recovery decreased gradually with time, the recovery of oxytocin (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>) and the remaining percentage of oxytocin monomers (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>) after 6&#x000a0;months storage at 40&#x000b0;C were increased up to 80% in the presence of 50&#x000a0;mM calcium, and even higher (up to 90%) in the presence of 50&#x000a0;mM magnesium.

The titration of calcium ions into an oxytocin solution in citrate buffer resulted in an exothermic reaction (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>) with a K<sub>a</sub> value of about 400&#x000a0;M<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> and an apparent ion/oxytocin stoichiometry close to 4:1 (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">I</xref>). Remarkably, when titrating magnesium into oxytocin we observed heat absorption (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>) and this endothermic reaction occurred with an identical apparent stochiometry (4:1) and a similar Ka value of about 200&#x000a0;M<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> as with calcium ions. However, with magnesium ions the ITC trace was complex and showed an exothermic phase at magnesium concentrations below 5&#x000a0;mM. Due to the rapid saturation of this early phase&#x02014;typically, within three injections&#x02014;and the low enthalpy of the ion/oxytocin interaction it was not possible to quantitatively analyze the exothermic stage. To analyze the following endothermic phase we omitted the first 4-titration steps and fitted the remaining data using a single site model. A similar dual-phase response was observed for the zinc:oxytocin interaction (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>, <bold>open</bold> triangles), but the exothermic and endothermic stages were well-resolved and suitable for the analysis using a two sites model (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">I</xref>). In contrast, in the presence of acetate buffer there was no measurable interaction between oxytocin and calcium, magnesium, or zinc ion (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b</xref>).

The improved stability was found to be dependent on the divalent metal ions concentration.</p><p>The WHO reported that there is no loss of potency of oxytocin in injection preparation after 12&#x000a0;months refrigerated storage (2&#x02013;8&#x000b0;C). However, oxytocin lost 14% of its potency after 1&#x000a0;year at 30&#x000b0;C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>). In another study, the oxytocin concentration in Ringer's lactate solution was reduced by about 10% after 35&#x000a0;days storage at room temperature (near 23&#x000b0;C) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>). From our observation Ringer's lactate solution was able to stabilize oxytocin in aqueous solution at low temperature (4&#x000b0;C). However at a higher temperature (55&#x000b0;C), the stability of Ringer's lactate solution was poorer than in the presence of citrate or acetate buffers. This result can be attributed to the pH and/or the amount of metal ions in solution. Oxytocin in Ringer's lactate solution has a pH of 6.4 and contains less than 2&#x000a0;mM of divalent metal ions. Hawe <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>) observed that the degradation of oxytocin strongly depends on the pH of the formulation, with the highest stability at pH&#x000a0;4.5. Therefore, a pH of 6.4 might have caused an increased rate of decomposition. However, formulating oxytocin in acetate buffer at pH&#x000a0;4.5 only maintain approximately 30% oxytocin recovered after 1&#x000a0;month storage at 55&#x000b0;C.</p><p>The decomposition of oxytocin is mainly caused by deamidation, oxidation, hydrolysis, and dimerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>). Deamidation is likely to occur in Gln<sup>4</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>), Asn<sup>5</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>), and Gly<sup>9</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>). Under acidic condition (pH below 3), deamidation of Asn<sup>5</sup> and Gln<sup>4</sup> occur by direct hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>). Oxidation might occur at Tyr<sup>2</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>) and Cys<sup>1,6</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>), whereas dimerization might occur due to thiol exchange in Cys<sup>1,6</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>).</p><p>Although the specific mechanism has not been elucidate yet, the presence of sufficient amounts of divalent metal ions at pH&#x000a0;4.5 in citrate buffer, however, greatly improved the stability of oxytocin in aqueous solution. In previous studies, the interaction of oxytocin with calcium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>) and zinc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>) ions was investigated using NMR and nanoelectrospray mass spectrometry (MS). Those studies which were also supported with molecular modeling, showed that Ca<sup>2+</sup> is coordinated by seven carbonyl oxygen atoms (O-Tyr<sup>2</sup>, O-Ile<sup>3</sup>, O-Gln<sup>4</sup>, O-Asp<sup>5</sup>, O-Cys<sup>6</sup>, O-Leu<sup>8</sup>, and O-Gly<sup>9</sup>) which formed a more compact structure for the oxytocin&#x02013;Ca<sup>2+</sup> complex compared to free oxytocin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>). Whereas zinc ions formed an octahedral complex with six of the backbone carbonyl oxygen atoms (O-Tyr<sup>2</sup>, O-Ile<sup>3</sup>, O-Gln<sup>4</sup>, O-Cys<sup>6</sup>, O-Leu<sup>8</sup>, and O-Gly<sup>9</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>). It was suggested that in the presence of such divalent ions, the hydrophobic groups are situated inside the peptide keeping them away from water molecules. These conformational changes can increase the stability of oxytocin in aqueous medium as they will prevent dimerization and further aggregation by hydrophobic interactions among oxytocin molecules. Metal salts are often used to stabilize peptides or proteins by chelation or ionic interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>). Wang <italic>et al</italic>. examined the peptide (P66) stability in the presence of ZnCl<sub>2</sub>, MgCl<sub>2</sub>, and CaCl<sub>2</sub> in non aqueous solution, and found that in the presence of 1&#x000a0;mM ZnCl<sub>2</sub>, P66 was significantly stabilized. However in the aqueous solution (pure water), these ions did not show any stabilizing effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>). In our experiments, the addition of calcium, magnesium, and zinc ions in combination with citrate buffer had a large impact on oxytocin stability in contrast to similar experiments in pure water or acetate buffer. This study suggests that there is a synergistic effect between citrate buffer and the divalent metal ions, possibly due to the protection of the disulfide bridge by complex formation of divalent metal ion and citrate with oxytocin which suppressed intermolecular reaction leading to tri/tetrasulfide formation as well as dimerization (unpublished data).</p><p>ITC is a sensitive method for studying the thermodynamics of binding events and quantifying binding reactions. When divalent metal ion are added to oxytocin, the ITC data indicate an interaction between oxytocin and Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Mg<sup>2+</sup>, or Zn<sup>2+</sup> ions in the presence of citrate buffer. Both Mg<sup>2+</sup> and Zn<sup>2+</sup> ions demonstrated complex, dual-phase interaction profile, while a single phase was observed for Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Each interaction was entropy driven, while both exothermic and endothermic reactions were observed. It may be speculated that the solvation effect, <italic>i.e.</italic>, release of structured water molecules plays a key role in binding, while the specific ion&#x02013;oxytocin interaction further contributes to the complex stability. The latter is also predicted by molecular dynamic simulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>). Remarkably, no interaction between oxytocin and either of the tested ions was detected in the acetate buffer or deionized water. These observations underscore the role of a particular environment in the ion&#x02013;oxytocin interaction and agree well with our findings on the peptide stability. Isothermal titration calorimetric measurements were predictive for the effects observed during the stability study.</p><p>In conclusion, this study shows that with a combination of divalent metal salts and citrate buffer, the stability of oxytocin in aqueous solution can be strongly improved. The increased stability of oxytocin aqueous formulations was achieved in the presence of citrate acid buffer and 2&#x000a0;mM or more of the salts CaCl<sub>2</sub>, MgCl<sub>2</sub>, or ZnCl<sub>2</sub>. The oxytocin stability is further increased with increasing concentration of the divalent metals ions up to 50&#x000a0;mM. In combination with citrate buffer, Zn<sup>2+</sup> has a superior stabilizing effect as compared with Ca<sup>2+</sup> or Mg<sup>2+</sup>.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors want to thank MSD Oss for providing oxytocin for the study.
