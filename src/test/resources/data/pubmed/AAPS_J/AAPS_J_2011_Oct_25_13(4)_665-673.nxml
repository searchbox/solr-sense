The population pharmacokinetics of telapristone (CDB-4124) and CDB-4453 was investigated using nonlinear mixed-effects modeling. Data from two clinical studies (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;32) were included in the analysis. A two-compartment (parent) one compartment (metabolite) mixture model (with two populations for apparent clearance) with first-order absorption and elimination adequately described the pharmacokinetics of telapristone and CDB-4453. Telapristone was rapidly absorbed with an absorption rate constant (Ka) of 1.26&#x000a0;h<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>. Moderate renal impairment resulted in a 74% decrease in Ka. The population estimates for oral clearance (CL/F) for the two populations were 11.6 and 3.34&#x000a0;L/h, respectively, with 25% of the subjects being allocated to the high-clearance group. Apparent volume of distribution for the central compartment (V2/F) was 37.4&#x000a0;L, apparent inter-compartmental clearance (Q/F) was 21.9&#x000a0;L/h, and apparent peripheral volume of distribution for the parent (V4/F) was 120&#x000a0;L. The ratio of the fraction of telapristone converted to CDB-4453 to the distribution volume of CDB-4453 (Fmet<sub>est</sub>) was 0.20/L. Apparent volume of distribution of the metabolite compartment (V3/F) was fixed to 1&#x000a0;L and apparent clearance of the metabolite (CLM/F) was 2.43&#x000a0;L/h. A two-compartment parent-metabolite model adequately described the pharmacokinetics of telapristone and CDB-4453.

However, many of the potential candidates also exhibited potent antiglucocorticoid activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>). Additional anti-progestins have been synthesized and tested in order to identify candidates that are progesterone antagonist with little to no antiglucocorticoid activity. Telapristone (US adopted name: telapristone acetate) was one of the compounds developed by the Contraception and Reproductive Health Branch (National Institute of Child Health and Human Development) for the chronic treatment of symptoms associated with endometriosis and leiomyoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>).</p><p>Telapristone opposes progesterone action at the molecular and receptor level, and has been shown in animals to exhibit potent anti-progesterone effects. Administration of telapristone to endometriosis-induced cynomolgus monkeys demonstrated that telapristone lead to reduction in the height and development of the endometrium as well as changes in the mitotic index, glands and stroma. It was also noted that telapristone was not associated with any antiglucocorticoid activity, as shown by a lack of measurable increase in serum cortisol. Clinical evaluation of hormone levels and ovulation showed that telapristone did not affect serum estrogen or progesterone and did not appear to affect ovulation when used once every 7&#x000a0;days.</p><p>A phase I/II study (ZN001) in pre-menopausal women (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;30) with symptomatic leiomyoma was completed (Trial identification number: CTNNCT01069094). It consisted of a single-dose pharmacokinetic arm (telapristone only) followed by a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled safety trial of three doses of telapristone (12.5, 25, and 50&#x000a0;mg) given once a day for 3&#x000a0;months and intramuscular (3.75&#x000a0;mg) Lupron Depot (leuprolide acetate) given once a month for 3&#x000a0;months. Single-dose pharmacokinetic results showed a bi-phasic decline in concentration for all subjects. Telapristone was rapidly absorbed reaching peak levels in 0.5&#x02013;2&#x000a0;h. Telapristone exhibited linear kinetics over the dose ranges tested. Overall findings were more favorable to the telapristone treatment groups, particularly the 50&#x000a0;mg when compared with Lupron Depot and placebo. Telapristone subjects experienced fewer bleeding days as well as a greater reduction in global tumor size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>).</p><p>The reduced antiglucocorticoid activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>), indications that physiologic concentrations of estrogen are preserved and results from efficacy trials for both uterine fibroids and endometriosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>), suggest that telapristone may offer advantages in both safety and efficacy that other currently available treatments do not.</p><p>Data in mice indicates that telapristone is primarily metabolized in the liver. It has been proposed that telapristone (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) undergoes demethylation to produce mono (CDB-4453) and didemethylated metabolites as well as hydroxylation of the propynyl group to produce the hydroxylated metabolite. Like mifepristone, it is proposed that metabolism of telapristone to the monodemethylated and hydroxylated metabolite is rapid, but formation of the didemethylated metabolite occurs more slowly and to a much lesser extent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>). Out of the three characterized metabolites, <italic>in vitro</italic> data indicated that CDB-4453 was equipotent to CDB-4124 as an anti-progesterone. In addition, a study evaluating the <italic>in vitro</italic> activity of CDB-4453 showed that it had less antiglucocorticoid activity than telapristone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>). Since CDB-4453 and telapristone share similar anti-progestational activity <italic>in vitro</italic>, the presence of CDB-4453 might contribute significantly to the <italic>in vivo</italic> anti-progesterone activity of telapristone. Therefore, it is important to understand the kinetics of both telapristone and CDB-4453.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Proposed metabolism of telapristone</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12248_2011_9304_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p>Information pertaining to the pharmacokinetics and sources of variability within parameter estimates for telapristone and CDB-4453 is limited. The aim of this analysis was to develop a pharmacokinetic model for telapristone and CDB-4453, evaluate the effects of covariates on the interindividual variability associated with parameters, and simulate concentration time profiles of telapristone and CDB-4453 in order to assess the range of variability in pharmacokinetic parameters.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Description of Studies</title><p><italic>Study ZP-005</italic> was a phase I/II, open-label study to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics of telapristone in female patients with moderate hepatic impairment (meeting the Child&#x02013;Pugh class B severity criteria) <italic>versus</italic> healthy volunteers.

Sample analysis involved the extraction of telapristone or CDB-4453, and the internal standard mifepristone, using protein precipitation. This extract was then subjected to reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography on an Aquasil C18 column and detection of the analytes by tandem mass spectroscopy using the Sciex API3000 LC/MS/MS. The lower limit of quantification was 5&#x000a0;ng/mL. The coefficient of variation for intra-assay precision and accuracy ranged from 1.5% to 4.7% and &#x02212;1.0% to 5.5%, respectively. This method was previously validated over the range of 5.00&#x02013;1,000&#x000a0;ng/mL with 100-&#x003bc;l aliquot volume.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Data Analysis</title><sec id="Sec6"><title>Population Pharmacokinetic Analysis</title><p><bold>Data Handling</bold> Due to the difference in molecular weight of telapristone (505.6&#x000a0;g/mol; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ama-assn.org/resources/doc/usan/telapristone-acetate.pdf">http://www.ama-assn.org/resources/doc/usan/telapristone-acetate.pdf</ext-link>) and CDB-4453, concentrations of telapristone and CDB-4453 were converted to equivalent nanomoles per liter. Concentrations of telapristone and CDB-4453 were also log-transformed before the analysis. All concentration values below the quantification limit (BQL) of the assay were excluded from the pharmacokinetic analysis.</p><p><bold>Base Pharmacokinetic Model</bold> Non-linear mixed-effect model building was conducted using NONMEM&#x000ae; 7 (ICON Development Solutions, Ellicott City, MD, USA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>) with G95 Fortran compiler (Free Software Foundation, Boston, MA, USA). All models were fitted using the first-order conditional estimation method. Output was processed using PDx-Pop 4.0 (ICON Development Solutions, Ellicott City, MD, USA) and Xpose version 4.0 (Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>). Graphical plots were produced using S-PLUS version 8.1 (TIBCO, Somerville, MA, USA) and R 2.11.1 (Free Software Foundation, Boston, MA, USA). Model selection was guided by the plausibility of the estimates, minimum objective function value (MOFV), Akaike Information Criterion, condition number, visual inspection of diagnostic plots and the precision of parameter estimates.Based on visual inspection of the concentration-time profiles of telapristone and CDB-4453, and previously published data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>), two- and three-compartment pharmacokinetic models for the parent and one- and two-compartment models for the metabolite were fitted to the data simultaneously to determine the best structural model. Elimination was assumed to occur from the central compartment as a first order process, and conversion of telapristone to CDB-4453 was considered to be an irreversible process.Interindividual variability (IIV) of the pharmacokinetic parameters was modeled assuming a log-normal distribution, as follows:<disp-formula id="Equa"><alternatives><tex-math id="M1">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

Continuous covariates available for screening were age, weight, height, BMI, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and creatinine clearance (CrCl). Categorical covariates available were hepatic and renal impairment status. Covariates were initially screened for inclusion using visual inspection of the IIV <italic>versus</italic> covariates plots and generalized additive modeling using Xpose. The potential covariates were then tested for statistical significance using the stepwise forward addition, followed by stepwise backward elimination procedure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>). An MOFV change of 3.84 (corresponding to a significance level of 5% at 1 degree of freedom) was used as the cutoff to include a covariate in stepwise forward addition. For a covariate to remain in the model during backward elimination, a change in MOFV of at least 10.83 (corresponding to a significance level of 0.1% at 1 degree of freedom) was needed. An improvement in the precision of the parameter estimate (relative standard error), and reduction in intersubject and residual variability were also used to determine the importance of the covariate as a predictor.</p><p><bold>Mixture Model</bold> Comparison of total clearance of telapristone, via noncompartmental analysis, showed that generally, subjects could be separated into two clearance groups based on metabolic ratios (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). The reason for the differences seen in clearance is unknown. Since inclusion of covariates did not account for the differences seen in total clearance of telapristone, a mixture model (using the $MIXTURE subroutine in NONMEM&#x000a9;) was employed in order to model two subpopulations for total clearance of telapristone. Because the NONMEM&#x000a9; output results only gives the overall probability of being in a particular group, individual objective value contributions were used to evaluate the probability of a subject being in each population. This was done using the method published by Carlsson <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>).

There appeared to be some bias in the predictions of telapristone concentrations at the earlier time points such that concentrations were underpredicted. Inspection of individual concentration time profiles (observed, individual-predicted, and population-predicted values) did not show any systematic biases; however, there were some subjects that appeared to exhibit a lag time while others did not.</p><p>Since Fmet<sub>est</sub> (Fmet/V<sub>app</sub>) was estimated to be 0.20&#x000a0;L<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, and Fmet can be no greater than 1; the apparent volume of distribution of the metabolite (V3/F) cannot be greater than 5&#x000a0;L. Therefore, it appears that the central volume of distribution of the metabolite is smaller than that of the parent. The removal of methyl group from a parent compound could lead to a more polar metabolite. Therefore, the smaller volume of distribution of CDB-4453 could be due to increased hydrophilicity as a result of the removal of the methyl group.</p><p>The only significant covariate found in this analysis was moderate renal impairment on absorption rate constant. The effect of renal impairment on absorption rate constant has been reported previously in literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>). Changes in the gastrointestinal tract as a result of renal insufficiency could result in delayed gastric emptying. This, in turn, can lead to a decrease in the rate of absorption of the drug, and hence increase time to reach maximal concentration (T<sub>max</sub>). Although delayed gastric emptying can lead to an increase in T<sub>max</sub>, it generally does not affect the extent of absorption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>). A delay in T<sub>max</sub> might be problematic in drugs that are administered acutely, as the onset of a response might be delayed. However, for chronic treatment, as is the case of telapristone, the effect of a decrease in absorption rate constant might be clinically irrelevant. Since creatinine clearance did not meet the inclusion criteria to be tested as a covariate, it is believed that the effect of moderate renal impairment is not directly related to the disease state (<italic>e.g</italic>., changes in glomerular filtration rate). Rather, it might be a reflection of other pathophysiological states precluding or resulting from chronic renal impairment. The lack of significance of hepatic impairment as a covariate is important since it is believed that the majority of telapristone is primarily metabolized in the liver. This suggests that dosage adjustment may not be required on a pharmacokinetic basis in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. Although the ranges of values for the covariates tested were wide, the sample size was very small. Therefore, a larger sample size might be required to detect additional covariate effects.</p><p>The detection of two subpopulations for total clearance might reflect the polymorphic metabolism of telapristone to CDB-4453. The percentage of the population in the low- and high-clearance groups was 75% and 25%, respectively. Since it is proposed that telapristone utilizes the same metabolic pathways as mifepristone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>), the cytochrome P450 (CYP) that would be responsible for production of the major metabolites of telapristone is CYP3A4 and 3A5. Even though there is known pharmacokinetic interindividual variability in drugs that are substrates for CYP3A4, there are no known polymorphisms that result in phenotypic differences in drug metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>). On the other hand, CYP3A5 is known to be polymorphic and have overlapping substrates with CYP3A4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>). Studies show that functioning CYP3A5 is present in 10&#x02013;40% of the Caucasian population, approximately 50% of African Americans, and about 33% of Asians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>). Individuals that express CYP3A5 also express CYP3A4 and it is believed that the presence of both of these CYPs lead to an increase in clearance of drugs that are substrates for both enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>). Based on the percentages of the study population in the high- and low-clearance groups, it is hypothesized that, like mifepristone, telapristone is both a substrate for CYP3A4 and CYP3A5. Additional studies are needed to evaluate telapristone metabolic pathways.</p><p>Because telapristone acetate is being developed for the chronic treatment of symptoms associated with leiomyoma and endometriosis, steady-state simulations are important for evaluating the pharmacokinetics of telapristone and CDB-4453. The resulting higher total <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub> and AUC<sub>0&#x02013;24</sub> in the low-clearance group compared to the high-clearance group at steady state could be the result of the longer half-life of telapristone seen in the low-clearance group. A longer half-life could lead to greater accumulation of the drug. Therefore, the presence of two groups for total clearance may play an important role in the efficacy/toxicity of telapristone and CDB-4453 with long-term treatment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>In conclusion, a parent-metabolite mixture model adequately described the pharmacokinetics of telapristone and CDB-4453 after oral administration. Inclusion of a mixture model resulted in detection of two subpopulations for the total clearance of telapristone. Inclusion of renal impairment as a covariate resulted in a decrease in the absorption rate constant of telapristone. It is believed that the significance of moderate renal impairment on absorption rate constant was not directly attributed to renal impairment (in terms of decrease glomerular filtration rate/changes in creatinine clearance).
