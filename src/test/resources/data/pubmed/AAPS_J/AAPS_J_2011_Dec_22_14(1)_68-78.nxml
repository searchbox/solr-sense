We investigated the effect of cyclosporine (Cs) and rifampin on the pharmacokinetics of macitentan and its metabolites ACT-132577 and ACT-373898 in healthy male subjects. In addition, <italic>in vitro</italic> studies were performed to investigate interactions between macitentan and its active metabolite ACT-132577 with human organic anion-transporting polypeptides (OATPs). The clinical study (AC-055-111) was conducted as a two-part, one-sequence, crossover study. Ten subjects in each part received multiple-dose macitentan followed by multiple-dose co-administration of Cs (part A) or rifampin (part B). In the presence of Cs, steady-state area under the plasma concentration&#x02013;time profiles during a dose interval (AUC<sub>&#x003c4;</sub>) for macitentan and ACT-373898 increased 10% and 7%, respectively, and decreased 3% for ACT-132577. Steady-state AUC<sub>&#x003c4;</sub> of macitentan and ACT-373898 in the presence of rifampin decreased 79% and 64%, respectively. For ACT-132577, no relevant difference in AUC<sub>&#x003c4;</sub> between the two treatments was observed. Macitentan co-administered with Cs or rifampin was well tolerated. The complementary <italic>in vitro</italic> studies demonstrated no marked differences in uptake rates of macitentan and ACT-132577 between the wild-type and OATP over-expressing cells over the concentration range tested. Concomitant treatment with Cs did not have any clinically relevant effect on the exposure to macitentan or its metabolites, at steady-state. Concomitant treatment with rifampin reduced significantly the exposure to macitentan and its metabolite ACT-373898 at steady-state but did not affect the exposure to the active metabolite ACT-132577 to a clinically relevant extent.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title><bold>KEY WORDS</bold></title><kwd>cyclosporine (Cs)</kwd><kwd>endothelin</kwd><kwd>macitentan</kwd><kwd>pharmacokinetics</kwd><kwd>rifampin</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="journal subjects"><kwd>Biomedicine</kwd><kwd>Biotechnology</kwd><kwd>Pharmacy</kwd><kwd>Pharmacology/Toxicology</kwd><kwd>Biochemistry, general</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; American Association of Pharmaceutical Scientists 2012</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Macitentan (ACT-064992) is an orally active, tissue-targeting dual endothelin ET<sub>A</sub> and ET<sub>B</sub> receptor antagonist (ERA) under phase 3 investigation in pulmonary arterial hypertension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>). In humans, macitentan shows a slow absorption; maximum plasma concentrations are achieved approximately 8&#x000a0;h after administration. In addition to macitentan, two metabolites, ACT-132577 (depropylated metabolite) and ACT-373898 (carboxylic acid metabolite), have been identified in plasma with ACT-132577 being pharmacologically active. While the elimination half-life (<italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub>) is approximately 16&#x000a0;h for macitentan, ACT-132577 has a <italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub> of approximately 48&#x000a0;h. ACT-373898 has a similar pharmacokinetic (PK) profile to macitentan. There are no notable differences in PK parameters of macitentan and its active metabolite between males and females and/or between Caucasian and Japanese subjects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>). In addition, macitentan can be given to subjects irrespective of food intake.</p><p>Early phase studies have shown macitentan to have a good safety and tolerability profile. The most frequently reported adverse event (AE) is headache (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>).</p><p>Cyclosporine (Cs) and rifampin were used to investigate the role of metabolism and drug transport in the disposition of macitentan. The immunosuppressant Cs is an inhibitor of CYP3A4, the hepatic uptake transporter organic anion-transporting polypeptide (OATP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>), and the efflux transporter P-glycoprotein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>). Rifampin, an antibiotic mainly used for the treatment of tuberculosis, is a strong inducer of CYP3A4 and an effective inhibitor of OATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>). As the metabolism of macitentan mainly relies on CYP3A4, the influence of these two drugs on the PK of macitentan is of particular interest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>). In addition, drug&#x02013;drug interactions (DDIs) at the level of hepatic OATPs have been documented following co-administration of other structurally related ERAs and Cs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>). As Cs and rifampin may be used concomitantly with macitentan in clinical practice, we investigated in a two-part, one-sequence, crossover study the effect of multiple-dose Cs (part A) and rifampin (part B) on the PK of macitentan and its metabolites. In addition, <italic>in vitro</italic> studies were performed to investigate interactions between macitentan and its active metabolite ACT-132577 with human OATP transporters.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Subjects</title><p>It was planned to enroll a total of 20 subjects, 10 in part A and 10 in part B. Healthy male subjects (based on medical history and screening examination) aged between 18 and 45&#x000a0;years, with body mass index (BMI) between 18 and 28&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup>, were eligible for this study. In addition, eligible subjects had to have hematology and clinical chemistry results within the normal range and negative results for drug and alcohol use at screening. Subjects were excluded from the study if they had received any drug with immunosuppressive potential within 6&#x000a0;months preceding the screening examination or if they were administered any metabolic enzyme-inducing or enzyme-inhibiting drugs within the last 4&#x000a0;weeks prior to the screening examination.</p><p>The ethics committee, Comit&#x000e9; de Protection des Personnes Ouest VI, located in Brest (France), approved the study protocol (study number AC-055-111), and all subjects gave written informed consent before any screening procedures were performed. The study was conducted in full conformity with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki, the EMEA Note for Guidance on Good Clinical Practice (CPMP/ICH/135/95), and International Ethical Guidelines for Biomedical Research Involving Human Subjects (Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences 2002).</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Clinical Study Design</title><p>This phase 1, single-center, open-label, two-part, one-sequence crossover study consisted of two parts. Each part comprised two periods: period 1, multiple-dose treatment with macitentan, and period 2, multiple-dose treatment with macitentan and Cs (part A) or multiple-dose treatment with macitentan and rifampin (part B).</p><p>An oral dose of 10&#x000a0;mg macitentan once daily was assessed in this study, which corresponds to the maximum dose used in the ongoing phase 3 program. The use of a 30-mg loading dose on day&#x000a0;1 reduced the time to reach steady-state conditions of ACT-132577 (day&#x000a0;4 instead of day&#x000a0;7). In the single-ascending dose study, doses of up to 300&#x000a0;mg had been well tolerated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>). In part A, after 5&#x000a0;days administration of macitentan, subjects were co-administered oral doses of 100&#x000a0;mg of Cs (1&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;100&#x000a0;mg capsule of Neoral<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>) every 12&#x000a0;h on days&#x000a0;6 through 17. The dose of 2&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;100&#x000a0;mg/day of Cs used in this study corresponds to approximately 2.9&#x000a0;mg/kg/day for a 70-kg man. This is within the recommended range for transplantation indications, i.e., 2 to 6&#x000a0;mg/kg/day, and is below the dose level of 5&#x000a0;mg/kg/day known to potentially increase creatinine and hypertension side effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>). Both drugs were administered after food.</p><p>In part B, after 5&#x000a0;days administration of macitentan, oral doses of 600&#x000a0;mg rifampin (two capsules of 300&#x000a0;mg Rifadin<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>) were co-administered once daily for 7&#x000a0;days, on days&#x000a0;6 through 12. This dosing regimen is approved for the treatment of tuberculosis and is recommended by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for assessment of its enzyme-inducing effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>). Since food intake has a significant effect on the PK of rifampin, drugs were administered under fasted conditions (1&#x000a0;h before a meal).</p><p>An End of Study examination, including vital signs, electrocardiogram (ECG), and clinical laboratory tests, took place 2&#x000a0;weeks after the last PK blood sampling, i.e., on day&#x000a0;32 (&#x000b1;2&#x000a0;days) of part A and on day&#x000a0;27 (&#x000b1;2&#x000a0;days) of part B. A telephone safety follow-up for serious adverse events (SAEs) took place 30&#x000a0;days after the last study drug administration.</p><p>Trough concentrations of macitentan and its metabolites were determined in blood samples taken from days&#x000a0;1 to 17 (part A) and from days&#x000a0;1 to 12 (part B) prior to daily macitentan administration. Twenty-four-hour concentration&#x02013;time profiles of macitentan and its metabolites on day&#x000a0;5 (96&#x02013;120&#x000a0;h) and day&#x000a0;17 (384&#x02013;408&#x000a0;h) (part A) or day&#x000a0;12 (264&#x02013;288&#x000a0;h) (part B) were determined in blood samples drawn immediately before and at 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, and 24&#x000a0;h after macitentan administration.</p><p>For each time point, approximately 3&#x000a0;mL of blood was collected from the subject in tubes containing ethylene diamine tetra-acetic acid. Within 30&#x000a0;min after collection, the tubes were centrifuged at approximately 1,500&#x000d7;<italic>g</italic> for 10&#x000a0;min at 2&#x000b0;C to 8&#x000b0;C.

Analytes were extracted from plasma by protein precipitation with ethanol (EtOH)/acetonitrile (50:50, <italic>v</italic>/<italic>v</italic>) containing the internal standards (polydeuterated analogs of macitentan, ACT-132577, and ACT-373898) and filtered through a protein precipitation plate (0.2&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m pore size), before injection into the high performance liquid chromatography system. The samples were subsequently analyzed by triple-stage quadrupole tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). The concentrations of the analytes were determined using the internal standardization method. The square of the correlation coefficient (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup>) was at least 0.9985 for macitentan, 0.9863 for ACT-132577, and 0.9932 for ACT-373898 in all runs. For macitentan, the inter-day precision (coefficient of variation) of control samples was &#x02264;8.6%, and inter-day inaccuracy ranged from &#x02212;4.3% to 5.3%. For ACT-132577, inter-day precision was &#x02264;7.0%, and inter-day inaccuracy ranged from &#x02212;5.7% to &#x02212;2.0%. For ACT-373898, inter-day precision was &#x02264;10.1%, and inter-day inaccuracy was in the range of &#x02212;9.3% to 1.8%. The lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) was 1&#x000a0;ng/mL for macitentan and ACT-132577, and 0.5&#x000a0;ng/mL for ACT-373898.</p><p>The measured individual plasma concentrations of macitentan, ACT-132577, and ACT-373898 were used to calculate PK parameters by model-independent analysis, using the WinNonlin 6.1 or Phoenix software packages (Pharsight Corporation, Mountain View, CA, USA). The measured individual plasma concentrations immediately before the morning dose of macitentan were used to directly obtain trough concentrations (<italic>C</italic><sub>tr</sub>). The area under the plasma concentration&#x02013;time curve (AUC) was calculated according to the linear trapezoidal rule, using the measured concentration&#x02013;time values above the LLOQ.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Safety Assessments</title><p>Tolerability and safety were evaluated by recording SAEs, AEs, clinical laboratory variables, vital signs, and 12-lead ECG during the study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>The effect of Cs and rifampin on the steady-state area under the plasma concentration time curve during a dose interval (AUC<sub>&#x003c4;</sub>) and <italic>C</italic><sub>tr</sub> of macitentan and its metabolites were explored using the ratio of geometric means and its 90% confidence intervals of macitentan + Cs (or macitentan + rifampin) <italic>versus</italic> macitentan.

The results of a previously performed study investigating the interaction between macitentan and ketoconazole, a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, showed a small effect of ketoconazole on the exposure to macitentan (approximately two-fold increase of the area under the plasma concentration&#x02013;time curve from zero to infinity [AUC<sub>0&#x02013;&#x0221e;</sub>]), which was not considered clinically relevant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>). Since Cs is a weaker CYP3A4 inhibitor than ketoconazole, a large effect of Cs on the exposure to macitentan through CYP3A4 inhibition was not expected. However, in this study, the investigation of a potential increase in exposure to macitentan through inhibition of OATP transporters by Cs was of greater interest. The results showed that in the presence of Cs, the exposure to macitentan and its metabolites did not change to a clinically relevant extent, which indicates no significant interaction between these two drugs at the level of metabolizing enzymes and/or transporters such as OATP.</p><p>This finding is different from that reported for other ERAs, such as ambrisentan or bosentan, which showed OATP involvement in the interaction of those ERAs with Cs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>). The significant initial increase in exposure to bosentan seen in the presence of Cs in humans (a 30-fold increase after the first day of co-administration of Cs) was attributed not only to the inhibition of metabolizing enzymes but mainly to the inhibition of OATP by Cs and consequently reduced hepatic uptake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>). Cs may be used concomitantly with pulmonary arterial hypertension therapies, particularly in those patients with connective tissue disease. In addition, calcineurin inhibitors, including Cs, are used to prevent host organ rejection during solid organ transplantation procedures. However, calcineurin inhibitors can limit the success of kidney transplantation due to calcineurin inhibitor-mediated nephrotoxicity. Data from previous studies suggest that some ERAs may attenuate Cs toxicity and may be useful in solid organ transplantation studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>); in contrast to other ERAs, macitentan does not show any interaction with Cs either at the level of CYP enzymes or at the level of OATP transporters. Therefore, macitentan in combination with Cs has potential to be successful in organ transplantation without the need for macitentan dose adjustment.</p></sec><sec id="d29e1314"><title>Part B</title><p>In the presence of rifampin, exposure to macitentan decreased markedly. This indicates that the metabolism of macitentan is induced in the presence of rifampin, a strong inducer of CYP3A4. Complex interactions have been observed between rifampin and a number of drugs, including ERAs, which are subject to both CYP3A4-mediated oxidation and OATP-mediated hepatic uptake. These studies have typically revealed a biphasic response characterized by an initial, transient increase in ERA plasma concentration with acute rifampin administration, presumably due to OATP inhibition, followed by reduction in exposure attributed to CYP3A4 induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>). Such biphasic effects of rifampin are not observed with macitentan, which further demonstrates the absence of a contribution from OATP to the disposition of macitentan. The initial increase seen in trough concentrations of ACT-132577 after the first doses of rifampin could be explained by an increase in macitentan metabolism at the level of CYP3A4, resulting in an increased transformation rate to ACT-132577. Rifampin has also been reported to be an inducer of conjugation enzymes, which render drugs more polar and facilitate their excretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>). In humans, conjugation enzymes are involved in the elimination of ACT-132577, which could in turn be induced by rifampin, accelerating the elimination of ACT-132577. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that the exposure to ACT-132577 after continued dosing (day&#x000a0;12) was very similar to that without rifampin. OATP is unlikely to be involved in the initial increase of exposure to ACT-132577 based on the fact that concomitant treatment with Cs, also a major inhibitor of OATP, did not show the same effect. Since both rifampin and macitentan would be administered on a multiple-dose basis if used together, the exposure at steady-state (day&#x000a0;5 compared to day&#x000a0;12) is considered to be the most relevant comparison between the two treatment conditions.</p><p>Macitentan and its metabolite ACT-132577 are both potent dual ERAs, and both contribute to the overall pharmacological effect of macitentan <italic>in vivo</italic>. ACT-132577 is approximately five-fold less potent than macitentan <italic>in vitro</italic>. However, systemic exposure in humans to ACT-132577 is 2.5-fold higher than to macitentan. Although the exposure to ACT-132577 at steady-state was not affected by concomitant treatment with rifampin, the approximately four-fold reduction in exposure to macitentan in the presence of rifampin might affect the overall pharmacological effect of the drug. Thus, reduced efficacy of macitentan in the presence of concomitant treatment with rifampin should be considered.</p><p>The results from <italic>in vitro</italic> OATP studies support the observations from the clinical study. High cellular uptake rates of macitentan and ACT-132577 in wild-type cells as well as OATP over-expressing CHO cells suggest that their cellular uptake does not depend on human OATP transporters but is likely to be driven by passive diffusion. A small contribution from active uptake could not be totally excluded, however, although compared to the high passive component, it is considered not to be relevant. The present <italic>in vitro</italic> data give a possible mechanistic explanation why the concomitant administration of the potent OATP inhibitor Cs did not increase the exposure to macitentan and ACT-132577 to a clinically relevant extent and explain why <italic>C</italic><sub>tr</sub> of macitentan did not show any immediate increase in the presence of rifampin.</p><p>The question whether macitentan and its active metabolite ACT-132577 could act as a perpetrator in DDIs was also assessed in <italic>in vitro</italic> studies. Macitentan and ACT-132577 exhibited an inhibitory potency on OATP1B1-mediated uptake of atorvastatin, as well as OATP1B3-mediated uptake of estrone-3-sulfate. Comparing the IC<sub>50</sub> values and total plasma concentrations of macitentan and ACT-132577 at steady-state in healthy subjects (approximately 0.63 and 1.5&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M, respectively) during a 10-mg once-daily regimen and binding of macitentan and ACT-132577 to human plasma proteins <italic>in vitro</italic> (99.6% and 99.5%, respectively) indicates that the free steady-state concentration of macitentan and ACT-132577 is around 2.5 and 7.3&#x000a0;nM, respectively. Since free steady-state macitentan and ACT-132577 plasma concentrations are around 2,490-fold lower than the lowest IC<sub>50</sub> determined, it appears unlikely that treatment with macitentan will affect the PK of co-administered OATP substrates.</p><p>Based on the guidance for industry issued in 2008 by the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, ACT-373898, identified in the human absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion study, was considered as a second major circulating metabolite of macitentan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>) and, therefore, was also analyzed in the present study. However, in view of the more recently issued guidance by the International Conference on Harmonization in 2010 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>), ACT-373898 is no longer considered a major metabolite.</p><p>Similar to previous phase 1 studies with macitentan, the most frequent TEAE was headache (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>). In part A, no hypertension or AEs relating to renal function, which are associated with Cs treatment, were reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>). Similarly in part B, no AEs associated with rifampin treatment were reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>). Overall, tolerability of macitentan when administered concomitantly with Cs or rifampin was good. However, the small number of subjects limits the interpretation of safety data in both parts of the study, and more data in a larger patient population are necessary to evaluate adequately the safety of macitentan in combination with Cs and rifampin.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec18" sec-type="conclusion"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>The observed effect of Cs on the exposure to macitentan and its metabolites ACT-132577 and ACT-373898 under steady-state conditions is not considered clinically relevant. Concomitant treatment with rifampin reduced significantly the exposure to macitentan and its metabolite ACT-373898 at steady-state but did not affect the exposure to the active metabolite ACT-132577 to a clinically relevant extent. Reduced efficacy of macitentan in the presence of rifampin should be considered. Hepatic uptake of macitentan and its active metabolite ACT-132577 does not depend on OATP.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title><bold>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</bold></title><p>All authors are employees of Actelion Pharmaceuticals Ltd., except for Dr. Homery who was the principal investigator of the clinical trial and was employee of the contract research organization BIOTRIAL RENNES.
