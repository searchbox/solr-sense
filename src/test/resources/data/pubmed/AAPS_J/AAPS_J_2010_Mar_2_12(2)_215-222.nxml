Generally, influenza vaccines need to be stored and handled refrigerated to prevent thermal degradation of the antigenic component. Requirement of a cold-chain, however, complicates stockpiling and the logistics of vaccine distribution. We, therefore, investigated the effect of elevated storage temperatures on the immunogenicity of a pre-pandemic influenza A H5N1 whole inactivated virus vaccine. Either suspended in liquid or kept as a freeze-dried powder, vaccines could be stored for 1&#x000a0;year at ambient temperature (20&#x000b0;C) with minimal loss of immunogenicity in mice. Elevation of the storage temperature to 40&#x000b0;C, however, resulted in a significant loss of immunogenic potency within 3&#x000a0;months if vaccines were stored in liquid suspension. In sharp contrast, freeze-dried powder formulations were stable at 40&#x000b0;C for at least 3&#x000a0;months. The presence of inulin or trehalose sugar excipients during freeze-drying of the vaccine proved to be critical to maintain its immunogenic potency during storage, and to preserve the characteristic Th1-type response to whole inactivated virus vaccine. These results indicate that whole inactivated virus vaccines may be stored and handled at room temperature in moderate climate zones for over a year with minimal decline and, if converted to dry-powder, even in hot climate zones for at least 3&#x000a0;months. The increased stability of dry-powder vaccine at 40&#x000b0;C may also point to an extended shelf-life when stored at 4&#x000b0;C. Use of the more stable dry-powder formulation could simplify stockpiling and thereby facilitating successful pandemic intervention.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>freeze-drying</kwd><kwd>inulin</kwd><kwd>pandemic influenza</kwd><kwd>vaccine stockpiling</kwd><kwd>whole inactivated influenza vaccine (H5N1)</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; American Association of Pharmaceutical Scientists 2010</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Animal influenza A viruses that cross the species barrier to humans pose a potential pandemic threat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>). Generally, these virus subtypes are antigenically different from the circulating human viruses and thus may spread rapidly in the immunologically na&#x000ef;ve population, if human-to-human transmission is sustained. Recently, a novel H1N1 influenza virus of combined swine, avian, and human origin became pandemic within 2&#x000a0;months after its emergence in humans in April 2009 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>). In terms of virulence, this virus is comparable to the H2N2 virus that caused the relatively mild pandemic of 1957 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>). However, a similar pandemic scenario with a more virulent virus subtype like the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 virus would be potentially catastrophic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>). With a lethality rate of approximately 60% in reported laboratory-confirmed human H5N1 cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>), maximum preparedness is warranted in case sustained human-to-human transmission were to evolve.</p><p>Vaccines and antivirals are critical assets in intervention strategies against pandemic influenza (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>). They represent the only countermeasures that are clearly efficacious in preventing infection and treating illness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>) and their availability plays a central role in pandemic preparedness planning. Prophylactic use of antivirals could provide short-term protection and may be helpful for early containment of an emerging pandemic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>). However, the control of infection in a pandemic will ultimately depend on protection provided by vaccination.</p><p>For the H5N1 virus, effective pre-pandemic vaccines have recently been developed, including whole inactivated virus (WIV) vaccine and split-virus vaccine combined with the oil-in-water emulsion adjuvants AS-03 or MF59 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>). Because the eventual pandemic virus may be an antigenic drift variant of the strain used to produce such pre-pandemic vaccines, a complete match with the pandemic strain cannot be guaranteed. However, the above vaccines have been shown to induce substantial cross-reactive immune responses to viruses of different H5N1 clades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>). Moreover, even at suboptimal efficacy, pre-pandemic vaccines may reduce attack rates if deployed in an early stage of the pandemic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>) or may serve as priming dose for the true pandemic vaccine, thus saving time and resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>). Stockpiling of pre-pandemic H5N1 vaccines is therefore considered an effective tool for containment and mitigation of an emerging pandemic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>), and stockpiles have already been established by multiple countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>).</p><p>Current inactivated influenza vaccine formulations need to be stored refrigerated because the major antigenic component, the viral hemagglutinin (HA), is prone to degradation at higher temperatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>). However, cold-chain requirements may seriously complicate the logistics of storage and deployment of pre-pandemic and pandemic vaccines, with a risk of vaccines escaping refrigeration. In general, cold-chain failure and thermal instability is a major cause of vaccine loss in developing countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>), and has been linked to serious disease outbreaks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>). Development of temperature-stable vaccines for pandemic use would promote worldwide usability by diminishing the complexity of refrigerated storage and distribution logistics.</p><p>A well-known strategy to improve stability is conversion of the liquid vaccine into dry powder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>). Biopharmaceuticals like influenza vaccines are preferably desiccated using freeze-drying techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>). The vaccine is rapidly frozen and water is, subsequently, extracted by sublimation under reduced pressure. Detrimental stresses acting on the HA antigenic components as a result of the freeze-dry process, as well as degradation of the HA during subsequent storage, can be counteracted by the use of cryoprotectants such as specific sugars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>). Sugar is mixed with the liquid vaccine, and during rapid freezing a glassy sugar matrix is formed in which water and vaccine constituents are captured. The physical barrier separating the vaccine constituents and molecular immobility provided by the matrix prevent the vaccine from degradation. Also, the matrix prevents further crystallization of water molecules upon extended cooling. After drying, the vaccine components are incorporated in a dry sugar glass, in which the water has been spatially replaced by sugar and the structural integrity of the vaccine constituents is preserved.</p><p>Here, we investigated the effect of ambient and high storage temperatures over time on the immunogenicity of influenza A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (H5N1) WIV vaccine. Vaccines were either stored conventionally in buffer solution or as sugar-stabilized dry-powder formulations and immunogenicity was assessed in a mouse model. Inulin and trehalose sugars, which have the intrinsic capacity to maintain a glassy state at high temperatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>), were used as stabilizing agents.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>METHODS</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Vaccine Preparation and Storage Conditions</title><p>H5N1 virus (NIBRG-14) was provided by the National Institute for Biological Standards and Controls (NIBSC, Potters Bar, UK), and is a 2:6 reassortant between A/Vietnam/1194/2004 (H5N1) and A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) virus produced by reverse genetics technology. WIV was obtained by virus propagation on embryonated chicken eggs, and inactivation of the virus preparation with 0.1% &#x003b2;-propiolactone.

The setting of the freeze-dryer was &#x02212;35&#x000b0;C for the shelf temperature, &#x02212;55&#x000b0;C for the condenser temperature, and 0.220&#x000a0;mbar pressure. After 24&#x000a0;h, the pressure was reduced to 0.060&#x000a0;mbar and the shelf temperature was gradually raised to 20&#x000b0;C. This status was maintained for another 24&#x000a0;h. The dried samples were either directly rehydrated for experiments or stored in a silica gel containing desiccator at 20&#x000b0;C or 40&#x000b0;C. The humidity in the desiccator was maintained at the level of 10&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;2% RH. As shown by Hinrichs <italic>et al.</italic> at 10% RH, trehalose and inulin glasses are equally hygroscopic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>).

Briefly, microtiter plates (Greiner, Alphen a/d Rijn, The Netherlands) coated with 0.2&#x000a0;&#x000b5;g influenza H5N1 (NIBRG-14) subunit vaccine per well were blocked with a 2% milk solution. Two-fold serial dilutions of serum samples in 0.05%Tween 20/PBS (PBS/T) were added to the wells in duplicate and incubated for 1.5&#x000a0;h. Bound H5N1-specific IgG, IgG1 or IgG2a antibodies were detected with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG-isotype antibody (Southern Biotech, Birmingham, AL).

Immediately after drying, samples of each vaccine were reconstituted in water and tested alongside liquid WIV, to assess the effect of the actual freeze-drying process on the vaccines, and to obtain reference values for the storage experiments. Evaluation involved assessment of the hemagglutination or hemolytic activities of the vaccines as a measure for the structure and function of the viral particles. Any effect of inulin or trehalose on the hemagglutination and hemolysis assay was excluded, by testing a similar concentration of the freeze-dried sugar without viral particles.

Clearly, at 20&#x000b0;C, the effect of storage duration on the immunogenic potency of the vaccine was minimal for liquid WIV and FDT and FDI vaccine. IgG titers dropped maximally by a factor of 1.9 (liquid WIV), and the maximum effect on HI titers was a twofold reduction (FDT and FDI), after 1&#x000a0;year of storage (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>/b). More than twofold reductions in IgG or HI titers were only seen for FD vaccine after 3&#x000a0;months storage. In conclusion, liquid WIV and sugar-stabilized freeze-dried WIV revealed only minor reductions in the immunogenicity after 1&#x000a0;year of storage at 20&#x000b0;C. At this condition, substantial deterioration of immunogenicity of WIV vaccine was seen only for WIV freeze-dried in absence of sugar excipient.

Freeze-drying in absence of a stabilizing sugar excipient reduced the IgG2a/IgG1 ratio to the level of a mixed IgG2a/IgG1 phenotype.

In contrast, FDT and FDI vaccine induced an IgG2a-dominated antibody response after storage independent of storage duration and temperature.

The HA antigens provide the B-cell epitopes and define the specificity of the antibody response, while the viral particle acts as a vehicle for the vaccines primary immunopotentiating agent, the viral single-stranded RNA (ssRNA). Its immunopotentiating activity is exerted through binding to Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) in the endosomes of recipient host cells, and triggering of the innate immune system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>). To a large extent, this mechanism accounts for the superior immunogenicity of WIV compared to split-virus formulations or subunit vaccines, which do not contain intact viral RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>). TLR7 signaling also determines the response type, being characteristically of a Th1 type for WIV, with a high amount of IgG2a/c antibodies in mice.</p><p>In liquid WIV vaccine, the antigenic properties of HA and the immunopotentiating activity provided by the ssRNA appear to be remarkably stable. Our results show that the immunogenicity of WIV vaccine stored in buffer solution at 20&#x000b0;C remained well preserved with minimal loss of activity over a period of at least 12&#x000a0;months. In contrast, seasonal subunit vaccine (H3N2) stored in buffer solution at ambient (25&#x000b0;C) temperature was reported to lose potency already over a period of 12 to 20&#x000a0;weeks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>). Compared to subunit vaccine, WIV, therefore, appears to be more stable. Yet, it should be noted that the comparability of the two studies is limited since they differ in the virus strains used for vaccine production and the method by which vaccine stability was assessed (<italic>in vivo</italic> immunogenicity <italic>versus</italic> SRID (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>)). At high storage temperature (40&#x000b0;C), the immunogenic potency of liquid WIV rapidly deteriorated. Progressive degradation of HA antigens and/or loss of intact viral particles, as reflected in the strongly reduced hemagglutination and hemolytic activity of the vaccine, may likely be the cause. Yet, the antibody response remained Th1 skewed, which may indicate that a small amount of viral particles escaped degradation, as it was shown previously that even a very low dose of viral particles is sufficient for Th1 skewing of the response to WIV vaccine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>).</p><p>At high storage temperature, dry-powder formulations were superior to liquid WIV, as reported by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>). With the use of sugar stabilization no substantial loss of immunogenicity was observed after storage of freeze-dried WIV for 3&#x000a0;months at 40&#x000b0;C. Furthermore, sugar stabilization played a critical role in preserving the Th1-skewing capacity of the vaccine during freeze-drying and subsequent storage. Freeze-drying in absence of sugar led to a mixed Th1/Th2 antibody response, which further shifted during storage at elevated temperature to an overt Th2 type response, while the characteristic Th1 phenotype of the WIV response was retained when sugars were used during freeze-drying. Sugar molecules obviously play a role in preserving effective TLR7 signaling by the ssRNA, probably by stabilizing the viral particle structure and protecting the viral ssRNA from degradation. Sugars are known to stabilize enveloped viruses during freeze-drying (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>), and trehalose and inulin have the capacity to stabilize lipid bilayers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>). In freeze-drying experiments with &#x02018;empty&#x02019; viral envelopes (virosomes), use of inulin was found to preserve the vesicular structure, while absence of sugar stabilization resulted in complete disintegration after rehydration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>). The mode of action of trehalose and inulin is presumably by replacement of the water molecules situated in between the hydrophilic heads of the lipids. Hereby, a detrimental phase transition of the viral membrane upon rehydration is prevented and the vaccine particles are preserved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>).</p><p>By assessing immunogenicity <italic>in vivo</italic> we discovered an important role for sugar compounds in preserving not only the quantity but also the quality of the immune response to WIV after freeze-drying and storage. Previous storage studies that showed improved stability of freeze-dried WIV used the hemagglutination assay to determine vaccine stability, which provides a quantitative measure only (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>). The shift from a Th1 response to WIV before freeze-drying to a Th2 response to WIV after freeze-drying in absence of sugar-stabilization could not have been predicted from hemagglutination results, nor by other <italic>in vitro</italic> tests that assess the integrity of the HA component, like the SRID. <italic>In vitro</italic> HA stability tests alone are therefore insufficient to obtain a complete representation of WIV vaccine stability.</p><p>The efficacy of influenza vaccines is determined by the induction of an effective antibody response. The serum HI titer, which is a measure for the magnitude of the antibody response, is the principle correlate of protection used to evaluate the efficacy of current human seasonal and pre-pandemic influenza vaccines. For seasonal vaccines an HI titer of &#x0003e;40 is considered to be protective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>). For the mouse model, no protective titer has been defined. Due to the intrinsic low immunogenicity of H5N1 virus and the single-dose immunization scheme the maximal titer reached in our experiments was 32. It has to be noted that immunogenicity in terms of HI and IgG titers does not necessarily correlate with protective efficacy. In the mouse model, the relative amounts of IgG1 and IgG2a (or IgG2c), expressed in the IgG2a/IgG1 ratio, appear to be decisive for protection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>). IgG2a-dominated responses are clearly more effective than IgG1-dominated responses. Yet, in the absence of significant differences in HI and IgG titers and similar IgG subtype dominance, as observed, for example, for liquid WIV, FDI, and FDT during storage at ambient temperatures, protective efficacy is likely to be comparable.</p><p>The preservability of WIV vaccine is strongly increased by sugar stabilization and freeze-drying. Similarly, other formulations like subunit, split-virus, and virosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>) vaccines have been successfully freeze-dried and stabilized with sugars (summarized in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>)). Yet, a combination of increased stability together with specific features of WIV which promote vaccine availability, like strong immunogenicity, dose sparing quality and manufacturing simplicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>), make dry-powder WIV an apt candidate formulation for pre-pandemic stockpiling. Based on the results of storage at 40&#x000b0;C it may also be predicted that dry-powder WIV will have a shelf-life exceeding that of liquid WIV, when kept under optimal refrigerated conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>). An extended vaccine shelf-life could delay costly replacement of stocks when vaccines reach their expiry date. In case of a pandemic emergency, deployment of dry-powder vaccine stocks may be exerted without refrigeration unless the temperatures are extremely high. This could speed up pandemic intervention and reduce losses due to cold-chain failures.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>The lack of suitable vaccines during the initial emergence of the New Influenza A (H1N1)swl pandemic virus in 2009, and its rapidly global spread underscores the importance of effective pre-pandemic vaccine stockpiles. Although this virus was of an unforeseen subtype, it remains important that stockpiles of vaccines against identified potentially dangerous virus strains like the H5N1 virus are prepared and kept in place. Our results suggest that for stockpiling liquid H5N1 WIV vaccine refrigeration may not be an absolute requirement to preserve the vaccines immunogenicity, as long as the temperature remains below 20&#x000b0;C. Furthermore, conversion from liquid to dry-powder formulation increases the versatility of WIV vaccine by allowing storage outside the fridge at higher temperatures, up to 40&#x000b0;C for at least 3&#x000a0;months. Because of its improved stability, use of sugar-stabilized freeze-dried H5N1 WIV vaccine could increase the efficacy of pre-pandemic stockpiling and subsequent vaccine deployment.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank the NIBSC for providing NIBRG-14 influenza virus.
