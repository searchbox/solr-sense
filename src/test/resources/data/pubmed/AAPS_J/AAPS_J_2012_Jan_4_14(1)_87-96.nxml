Rats were infused with 10 or 20&#x000a0;mg/kg quinidine over 30 min or 4&#x000a0;h. Plasma, brain extracellular fluid (brain ECF), and end-of-experiment total brain concentrations of quinidine were determined during 7&#x000a0;h after the start of the infusion. Effect of pretreatment with tariquidar (15&#x000a0;mg/kg, administered 30&#x000a0;min before the start of the quinidine infusion) on the brain distribution of quinidine was assessed. This approach was repeated in kainate-treated rats. Quinidine kinetics were analyzed with population modeling (NONMEM). The quinidine microdialysis assay clearly revealed differences in brain distribution upon changes in P-glycoprotein functionality by pre-administration of tariquidar, which resulted in a 7.2-fold increase in brain ECF and a 40-fold increase in total brain quinidine concentration. After kainate treatment alone, however, no difference in quinidine transport across the blood&#x02013;brain barrier was found, but kainate-treated rats tended to have a lower total brain concentration but a higher brain ECF concentration of quinidine than saline-treated rats. This study did not provide evidence for the hypothesis that P-glycoprotein function at the blood&#x02013;brain barrier is altered at 1&#x000a0;week after SE induction, but rather suggests that P-glycoprotein function might be altered at the brain parenchymal level.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>blood&#x02013;brain barrier</kwd><kwd>epilepsy</kwd><kwd>microdialysis</kwd><kwd>P-glycoprotein (P-gp)</kwd><kwd>quinidine</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="journal subjects"><kwd>Biomedicine</kwd><kwd>Biotechnology</kwd><kwd>Pharmacy</kwd><kwd>Pharmacology/Toxicology</kwd><kwd>Biochemistry, general</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; American Association of Pharmaceutical Scientists 2012</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>P-glycoprotein (P-gp) is the best studied efflux transporter at the endothelial capillaries constituting the blood&#x02013;brain barrier (BBB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>). It is responsible for reduced brain distribution of many clinically used drugs. For drugs aimed at systemic targets this can be a benefit as the action of P-gp will help to reduce central side effects. P-gp might, however, also hamper the ability of drugs to reach target sites within the brain. For example, about 30&#x02013;40% of all people with epilepsy do not become fully seizure free with current medications, even when treated at maximal tolerated doses. Lack of response in these individuals is not limited to a specific drug or drug class, but occurs with the complete range of anti-epileptic drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>). Thus, it has been hypothesized that increased P-gp expression in a subpopulation of people with severe epilepsy is, at least in part, responsible for pharmacoresistance by impairing drug access to the brain</p><p>There are many methods used to study drug distribution into the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>). However, most of these methods focus on total brain concentrations. Since brain tissue is rather lipophilic, total brain concentrations will often mainly reflect the lipophilicity of the drug, i.e., a lipophilic drug will have a higher total brain concentration than a more hydrophilic drug. If the transport across the BBB is of interest, methods that measure free concentrations in brain are needed, as a reflection of the fraction of the molecules in plasma that can pass the tightly connected cell membrane of the BBB. Microdialysis is the state-of-the-art methodology for measuring free drug concentrations in the brain. Transport processes at the BBB and the brain parenchyma can be separated by using microdialysis in combination with measurement of plasma and total brain concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>).</p><p>Quinidine, a substrate with high affinity for P-gp, was used in the present study as a model substrate for determining P-gp functionality at the BBB. To investigate the specific contribution of P-gp at the BBB, rats were studied without or with co-administration of the P-gp inhibitor tariquidar (TQD). Quinidine concentrations were determined in arterial plasma and extracellular brain fluid for 7&#x000a0;h after the start of quinidine administration. In addition, quinidine concentration in brain tissue was determined at the end of the experiment.</p><p>In rats, treatment with intraperitoneal (ip) injections of kainate leads to status epilepticus (SE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>). After a latent period of 3&#x02013;4&#x000a0;weeks post-SE, rats start to show spontaneous seizures. The kainate model in rats displays several features of temporal lobe epilepsy, the most common form of epilepsy frequently associated with pharmacoresistance, including an increase in P-gp expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>). In a recent positron emission tomography (PET) study it was shown that the brain distribution volume of the PET P-gp substrate tracer (<italic>R</italic>)<italic>-</italic>[<sup>11</sup>C]verapamil was increased in kainate-treated rats compared to control rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>). However, unlike microdialysis, PET measures total concentrations and hence pharmacokinetics at the level of the BBB <italic>versus</italic> intrabrain cannot be separated.</p><p>The aim of the present study was first develop a microdialysis method for studies of drug transport across the BBB and intrabrain distribution, and second, to investigate the influence of kainate treatment and TQD pre-administration on quinidine pharmacokinetics with focus on P-gp functionality, both at the BBB and brain parenchyma.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Chemicals and Solutions</title><p>Tariquidar (XR9576, TQD) was obtained from Xenova Group PLC (Cambridge, England) or API Services Inc.

The seizures were not interrupted by any anti-epileptic drug treatment. The mortality was less than 10%. Due to the design of this study it was not possible to determine whether these animals eventually would have developed spontaneous epilepsy, but the signs and symptoms during and after SE were very similar to those observed in previous studies where animals did develop epilepsy. Further, some of the kainate-treated animals had seizures during the microdialysis experiments. The seizures were usually provoked by stress, i.e., the rats experienced seizures during or just after being connected to the perfusion fluid syringe and sample collector.</p><p>Kainate treatment was found to be a significant covariate for the systemic clearance (CL) and volume of distribution in the peripheral plasma (<italic>V</italic><sub>2</sub>; see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> and Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">II</xref>).

Remarkably, kainate-treated rats tended to have a lower total brain concentration but a higher brain ECF concentration of quinidine than saline-treated rats. This suggests merely that the P-gp function in kainate-treated rats is altered at the parenchymal level rather than at the BBB. TQD pre-administration increased the brain ECF brain concentration 7.2-fold and the total brain concentration about 40-fold, supporting an important role for P-gp in intrabrain distribution. The effect of TQD was similar in control and kainate-treated rats.</p><p>Compared to many other methods, microdialysis has the important advantage of measuring the free (ECF) brain concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>). This concentration is relevant for estimating the transport across the BBB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>). In addition to the free concentrations that were measured with microdialysis over the whole study time, total quinidine concentrations were measured at the end of the experiment. Hence, the combination of microdialysis, plasma and total brain tissue concentrations produced a very rich data set including information on both transport across the BBB and distribution within the brain.</p><p>TQD treatment was used to inhibit the P-gp function. As mentioned, this resulted in a 7.2-fold increase in brain ECF-to-plasma concentration ratio and an approximately 40-fold increase in total brain-to-plasma concentration ratio. PET studies have shown 10&#x02013;15-fold increase in brain-to-plasma concentrations of the P-gp substrate (<italic>R</italic>)-[<sup>11</sup>C]verapamil after inhibition with 15&#x000a0;mg/kg TQD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>). PET data can be compared to total concentrations and thus, the present study indicates that quinidine might be a better model drug to study P-gp functionality than verapamil, as a large difference in concentration between baseline and P-gp inhibition states is desirable for a good P-gp function marker, regardless of whether PET or microdialysis is used. Another possible conclusion is that microdialysis as a method is more sensitive than PET to assess changes in P-gp functionality as it measures the free concentration, while the PET signal is not solely reflecting on processes at the BBB but also distribution within the brain. In the future, it would be very interesting to use <sup>11</sup>C-labeled quinidine as a PET tracer to be able to compare the read-out from microdialysis and PET. Initially, verapamil was also tried in the microdialysis setting, but due to extensive sticking of verapamil to the microdialysis tubing and probes this was not possible. When designing the present study, use of an anti-epileptic drug as a model drug was considered, but since a large difference between normal P-gp function and increased/decreased P-gp function was desired, it was concluded that a strong P-gp substrate, such as quinidine, was the best way to demonstrate proof of concept. In addition, quinidine as opposed to many other P-gp substrates, show no interaction with the other major efflux transporters, e.g., breast cancer resistant protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>).</p><p>All brain tissue samples were obtained at approximately the same time point, i.e., at the end of the experiment 7&#x000a0;h after the start of quinidine infusion, at which equilibrium was assumed to be reached. However, rate constants for distribution to and from the total brain compartment could not be estimated based on the present data set. Therefore, concentration of quinidine in brain tissue was in the final pharmacokinetic model described as a multiple (<italic>f</italic><sub>2</sub>) of the free brain ECF concentration. Previous studies (unpublished data) in our lab have showed that equilibrium between brain ECF and total brain concentrations is very rapid and hence even if brain samples had been obtained at different time points it would still have been possible to use the present model structure. The result showed that quinidine concentration is 8.7-fold higher in brain tissue than in brain ECF.</p><p>In epilepsy, it has been hypothesized that P-gp expression at the BBB is upregulated and hence contributes to the development of pharmacoresistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>). Therefore, it was also of interest to investigate the P-gp function in kainate-treated rats, a frequently used model for temporal lobe epilepsy, and compare quinidine pharmacokinetics in this epilepsy model both at baseline and after P-gp inhibition to na&#x000ef;ve control rats. Rats subjected to kainate induced SE become truly epileptic only after 3&#x02013;4&#x000a0;weeks when spontaneous seizures start to occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>), but the most prominent increase in P-gp expression has been reported between 1 and 7&#x000a0;days after SE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>). Thus, although seizures were not yet present at 1&#x000a0;week after induction of SE by kainate (apart from a few incidental observations), it can be assumed that at this time point after SE the brain both exhibits increased P-gp expression and is progressing towards the epileptic state. In a previously published study using the same epilepsy model, it was shown that the brain glucose metabolism, measured with <sup>18</sup>F-fluorodeoxyglucose, was significantly lower in kainate-treated rats 7&#x000a0;days post-SE than in controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>). It is a common clinical observation that <sup>18</sup>F-fluorodeoxyglucose uptake is decreased in epileptic brain tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>). This suggests that the kainate model in rats mimics some functional changes that have been observed in the human epileptic brain.</p><p>Kainate treatment influenced the plasma pharmacokinetics of quinidine by decreasing the clearance (CL) and the peripheral volume of distribution (<italic>V</italic><sub>2</sub>). There was no effect on the <italic>Q</italic><sub>in</sub> and <italic>Q</italic><sub>out</sub>, but kainate treatment decreased the volume of distribution in the brain, <italic>V</italic><sub>br</sub>. A decrease in <italic>V</italic><sub>br</sub> suggests higher concentrations of quinidine in the brain, which may appear to be a contradiction to the notion that kainate treatment should result in upregulation of P-gp and thus rather a decrease in brain concentrations. However, P-gp is not only expressed at the endothelial cells of the BBB but also at other cell types such as astrocytes and pericytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>). There are studies showing that breakdown of BBB function may be a consequence of an inflammatory response and that inflammation is a cause for P-gp upregulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>). In the normal healthy brain, P-gp is probably not an important player in the brain beyond the endothelial cells, but after SE, an inflammatory reaction could lead to upregulation of P-gp not only in endothelial cells, but also in glial cells and neurons and these may thus act as a &#x0201c;second line of defense in addition to the BBB&#x0201d; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>). Total brain concentrations appeared to be lower in kainate-treated although this effect did not reach significance in this study, probably due to a large variability in the different rat groups. In this context, the findings of Bankstahl <italic>et al</italic>. are of interest, as they reported that, after SE, total brain-to-plasma ratio of phenytoin in rats was lower, while the opposite was found in the brain dialysate to plasma ratio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>). Phenytoin is considered to be a (weak) P-gp substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>) and hence the results by Bankstahl <italic>et al</italic>. are in line with the results from the present study, i.e., that SE decreases the total brain concentrations and increases the free brain concentrations.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17" sec-type="conclusion"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Quinidine uptake in the brain was very low in both kainate- and saline-treated rats. The effect of TQD was similar in control and kainate-treated rats and TQD treatment increased total quinidine brain concentrations more than ECF concentrations. Kainate-treated rats tended to have a lower total brain concentration and a higher brain ECF concentration of quinidine than saline-treated rats. Thus, this study did not provide evidence for the hypothesis that P-gp function is altered at the endothelial capillaries constituting the BBB at 1&#x000a0;week after SE induction. However, the study indicated that P-gp functionality might be altered at the brain parenchyma.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Robin Hartman, Maaike Labots, and Nathalie Doorenweerd for help with the animal surgery and microdialysis experiments.
