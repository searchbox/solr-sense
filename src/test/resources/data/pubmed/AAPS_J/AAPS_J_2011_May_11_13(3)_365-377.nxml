The present study investigates the novel targets of the anticancer activity of ethanol extract of neem leaves (EENL) <italic>in vitro</italic> and evaluates the <italic>in vivo</italic> efficacy in the prostate cancer models. Analysis of the components in the EENL by mass spectrometry suggests the presence of 2&#x02032;,3&#x02032;-dehydrosalannol, 6-desacetyl nimbinene, and nimolinone. Treatment of C4-2B and PC-3M-luc2 prostate cancer cells with EENL inhibited the cell proliferation. Genome-wide expression profiling, using oligonucleotide microarrays, revealed genes differentially expressed with EENL treatment in prostate cancer cells. Functional analysis unveiled that most of the up-regulated genes were associated with cell death, and drug metabolism, and the down-regulated genes were associated with cell cycle, DNA replication, recombination, and repair functions. Quantitative PCR confirmed significant up-regulation of 40 genes and immunoblotting revealed increase in the protein expression levels of <italic>HMOX1</italic>, <italic>AKR1C2</italic>, <italic>AKR1C3</italic>, and <italic>AKR1B10</italic>. EENL treatment inhibited the growth of C4-2B and PC-3M-luc2 prostate cancer xenografts in nude mice. The suppression of tumor growth is associated with the formation of hyalinized fibrous tumor tissue and the induction of cell death by apoptosis. These results suggest that EENL-containing natural bioactive compounds could have potent anticancer property and the regulation of multiple cellular pathways could exert pleiotrophic effects in prevention and treatment of prostate cancer.</p><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1208/s12248-011-9279-4) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>gene expression profiles</kwd><kwd>neem leaf extract</kwd><kwd>therapeutic targets and prostate cancer</kwd><kwd>tumor models</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; American Association of Pharmaceutical Scientists 2011</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Prostate cancer is one of the most prevalent malignant neoplasms and the third leading cause of cancer-related death of men of the Western countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>). The mainstay of treatment of advanced prostate cancer is focused on suppression of intraprostatic testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>). However, after an initial response, therapy-resistant clones can appear and result in cancer progression and metastasis with high mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>). First-line chemotherapy for advanced prostate cancer has not demonstrated significant improvement in overall survival but could provide disease control and palliation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>). Novel treatment modalities are therefore needed to treat hormone-resistant tumors and to prevent the progression of hormone-sensitive prostate cancer to hormone-refractory stage. The search for compounds with few or no adverse effects that will prevent cancer progression and protect against the adverse biological effects of chemotherapeutic agents as compared with the agents currently in use is therefore of greatest relevance.</p><p>Herbal plants and plant-derived medicines have been used as the source of potential anticancer agents in traditional cultures all over the world and are becoming increasingly popular in modern society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>). The potential natural product-derived anticancer agents are known to possess various bioactive phytochemicals. Terpenoids constitute one of the largest families of natural products accounting for more than 40,000 individual compounds of both primary and secondary metabolisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>). Many herbal plants contain terpenoids, and several terpenoids have been shown to be available for pharmaceutical applications, for example, artemisinin and taxol as malaria and cancer medicines, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>). Neem is one such medicinal plant, the extract of which has been used for thousands of years for most acute and chronic diseases in India and Africa. The major biologically active constituents of neem leaves are limonoids, triterpenoids, nonterpenoids, phenolics, flavonoids, and meliacins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>), potentially targeting multiple signaling pathways of cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>). Extract of neem leaves have been reported to be non-toxic, non-mutagenic, and found to possess immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, and anticarcinogenic properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>). Neem leaf glycoprotein exhibited antitumor activity by activation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes and natural killer cells in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>). To date, there is only one report of neem on prostate cancer which showed the <italic>in vitro</italic> inhibition of PC-3 cell proliferation and Bcl-2 expression after neem treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>). No further studies of any neem compounds or extracts were reported on prostate cancer. The above reasoning promoted use to explore the antitumor effects of neem leaves on human prostate cancer cells which could lead to future clinical trials for prostate cancer patients.</p><p>Our study is designed to identify and evaluate the molecular targets of anticancer activities of ethanol extract of neem leaves (EENL) in prostate cancer models. We performed liquid chromatography/time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC/TOF-MS) analyses to identify the components in the EENL. To unravel the molecular effects of EENL in androgen-refractory metastatic prostate cancer cells, we used gene expression microarrays and identified target genes regulated in prostate cancer cells after treatment with EENL. We then confirmed the alterations in mRNA and protein expression levels of the genes. The antitumor activity of EENL was further evaluated in the prostate cancer mouse models using C4-2B and PC-3M-luc2 cells.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Ethanol Extraction of Neem Leaves</title><p>Neem tree leaves harvested during the summer season were obtained from Neem Tree Farms (Brandon, FL).

All the alcohol was evaporated at low temperature using Rotavapor R-200 (Buchi, New Castle, DE) under vacuum. The residue was freeze-dried and yielded approximately 1.0&#x000a0;g of the dried powder. This extracted powder was stored at &#x02212;20&#x000b0;C. An aliquot of 100&#x000a0;mg of this powder was dissolved in 250&#x000a0;&#x003bc;L of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) plus 250&#x000a0;&#x003bc;L of 100% ethanol (stock 200&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/&#x003bc;L).

The antiproliferative activity of EENL was measured by MTS assay. Vehicle-treated cells were included as a control. EENL exhibited a dose-dependent inhibition of C4-2B and PC-3M-luc2 cell growth over a broad range of concentrations (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 9.0 and 25.0&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/mL respectively, where IC<sub>50</sub> is the inhibition concentration at which a 50% inhibition of cell growth is observed at 24&#x000a0;h of treatment.

The gene expression profiling of C4-2B prostate cancer cells treated with EENL for 24&#x000a0;h showed significant up-regulation of 191 genes and down-regulation of 97 genes (greater than twofold), whereas the 48-h EENL-treated cells showed significant up-regulation of 129 genes and down-regulation of 965 genes (greater than twofold). Using the Ingenuity Pathways Knowledge Base, the dataset was used to map independently up- and down-regulated genes for the molecular and cellular functions. The most enriched functions of the up-regulated genes are cell death, cellular development, cellular growth and proliferation, lipid metabolism, and small molecule biochemistry. The majority of the up-regulated genes are associated with cell death function which indicates that EENL could play a vital role in promoting cell death. The most significant down-regulated gene functions are cell cycle, DNA replication, recombination, and repair, cellular assembly and organization, cellular movement, and gene expression. Greater than 70% of the down-regulated genes are associated with cell cycle and DNA replication, recombination, and repair functions which indicate that EENL could play a significant role in inhibition of tumor growth.</p><p>To validate the observed changes in gene expression, we chose 40 up-regulated genes for Taqman real-time PCR analysis and analyzed in both C4-2B and PC-3M-luc2 prostate cancer cells. For all genes tested, the direction of gene expression change measured by RT-PCR and microarray analysis agreed, although the magnitude of expression change was not always the same using these 2 different analytical methods. The RNA expression levels of 40 validated genes in C4-2B cells treated with 8.0&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/mL and PC-3M-luc2 cells treated with 20.0&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/mL of EENL for 24 and 48&#x000a0;h relatively increased (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">I</xref>). These results support the findings obtained from the microarray experiments. Though we only validated up-regulated genes, we believe these results can support the validity of down-regulated genes of our microarray data. The 40 most significantly down-regulated genes were shown from our microarray data of the C4-2B prostate cancer cells after EENL treatment (Supplementary Table S<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="">1</xref>).

Our study suggests that 2&#x02032;,3&#x02032;-dehydrosalannol, 6-desacetyl nimbinene, and nimolinone were present as major neem compounds in our EENL. In this study, we evaluated the anticancer effects of EENL in castration-resistant C4-2B and highly metastatic PC-3M-luc2 prostate cancer cells with an intent to use the neem extract for locally advanced and metastatic prostate cancer that is associated with considerable morbidity and mortality.</p><p>The extent of cell growth inhibition was measured by MTS assay which was used to determine the number of viable cells in proliferation. When various concentrations of EENL were used for treatment, EENL showed different sensitization potential; PC-3M-luc2 cells required higher concentrations of EENL compared to C4-2B to achieve the IC<sub>50</sub> effect. EENL treatment significantly inhibited the growth of both C4-2B and PC-3M-luc2 cells (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). To unravel the molecular targets involved in mediating the effect of EENL on prostate cancer cells, we used genome-wide microarray analysis. C4-2B prostate cancer cells treated with EENL showed a significant deregulation of 288 genes that increased to 1094 genes after 48&#x000a0;h. We further validated the expression of 40 significantly up-regulated genes by quantitative PCR in C4-2B and PC-3M-luc2 prostate cancer cells. PCR results were consistent with the microarray data. There was a significant up-regulation of the genes associated with the cell-to-cell signaling, cell death functions, drug metabolism and oxidative stress response (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">I</xref>), suggesting that the EENL is promoting cell death of the prostate cancer cells.

Our results revealed highly significant up-regulation in the RNA and protein expression levels of <italic>AKR1C2</italic>, <italic>AKR1C3</italic>, and <italic>AKR1B10</italic> with EENL treatment (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">I</xref> and Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). The increase in AKRs could contribute to the suppression of DHT levels observed in the C4-2B tumor tissues of EENL-treated mice. No DHT was detected in the PC-3M-luc2 tumors which supports previous finding that PC-3 cells do not express 5-reductase type II for conversion of testosterone to DHT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>). We speculate that up-regulation of AKRs expression with EENL treatment could inhibit cellular proliferation by inducing apoptosis and reduce the tumor growth. Further studies are required to evaluate the role of EENL induced AKRs on the DHT catabolism in prostate cancer cells.</p><p>We further evaluated the antitumor effect of the EENL using the xenograft prostate cancer models.</p><p>In mice injected with PC-3M-luc2 metastatic prostate cancer cells (3.0&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>6</sup> cells) maximum tolerable xenograft tumor growth was attained by 8&#x000a0;weeks of administration, whereas in mice injected with C4-2B cells (1.5&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>6</sup> cells) the xenograft tumor growth with was relatively slow and attained maximum tolerable tumor growth by 11&#x000a0;weeks. Our studies revealed that administration of EENL significantly suppressed the tumor growth (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). The most significant histological difference between EENL- and vehicle-treated mice were the presence of hyalinized fibrosis (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). We believe this hyalinization is a feature of tumor regression. Also, the control mice exhibited a greater amount of coagulative tumor necrosis, a feature typical of rapidly growing malignancies. Additional studies are necessary in large numbers of cases to further characterize these histological changes. It has been reported that fibrous tissue is related to decreased tumor invasiveness and is an indicator of improved survival after resection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>). These results are important to be explored further in the human clinical trials. We have demonstrated that reduction of tumor growth in mice is associated with apoptosis of tumor cells (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). There was no significant change in either body weight or histology of any major organs in the EENL-treated group compared to control group, which confirms that EENL at 100 and 200&#x000a0;mg/kg body weight has no adverse effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>). The dose administered in the present study (200&#x000a0;mg/kg body weight) was based on previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>). This dose is also far less than the oral median lethal dose LD<sub>50</sub> for EENL, which was found to be 4.57&#x000a0;g/kg body weight in acute toxicity studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>). We speculate that neem, with its low risk of toxicity, could be safely used in the prostate cancer prevention and treatment trials.</p><p>In summary, we demonstrated that EENL-containing natural bioactive compounds 2&#x02032;,3&#x02032;-dehydrosalannol, 6-desacetyl nimbinene, and nimolinone inhibited <italic>in vitro</italic> cell proliferation and <italic>in vivo</italic> tumor growth. For the first time, we used genome-wide profiling approach to identify the genes associated with multiple biological pathways as potential targets of the antitumor activity of EENL and demonstrated the up-regulation of the <italic>HMOX1</italic> and <italic>AKR</italic> protein changes. This is the first study to evaluate the antitumor effect of EENL in the preclinical models of prostate cancer. Our data suggests that the deregulated genes identified in our expression profiling could play an important role in the inhibition of tumor growth with the formation of hyalinized fibrous tissue. Further studies are required to unravel the role of these individual compounds in the EENL on tumor growth. The molecular targets identified in our study may be exploited for devising mechanism-based chemopreventive or therapeutic strategies for prostate cancer.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><sec id="AppESM1"><title>Electronic Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="d28e2278" content-type="local-data"><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.
